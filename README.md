### Info

A Pokémon Trading Card Collection Game where you collect cards from the scarlet and violet 151 series. Play games to collect pokécoins, open up packs, and buy the ones you're missing from the marketplace.

A school project to learn Typescript, TRPC and Prisma. The project is not meant to be a fully optimized game, but simply a challenge to see how far I can come with the knowledge I have at the time.
